For detect this malicious payloads and attackers on our web portals we have some WAF solutions like ModSecurity and etc. But i have coded a simple bash script that can detect malicoius payloads on web portals using webservers log files and i called it BashWAF.
WAF has various features that if I am interested, I will try to add different features to this tool.
I personally use this tool along with other solutions.
